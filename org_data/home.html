<h2>Welcome to the Australian Message Stick Database</h2>
<p>
Message sticks are carved graphic devices from Indigenous Australia, used to facilitate long-distance communication. This database is a digital repository of 1024 message sticks and associated metadata located in museums across the world. It also stores photographs and sketches of messages that are no longer extant. The database is searchable via 30 fields, including linguistic area, semantic domain, motifs and source. The full dataset will be migrated to this location soon. In the meantime click <a href="https://cdhrsys.anu.edu.au/occams_v1c/index.php" target="_blank">here</a> to visit the beta version and the Help link for access instructions.
